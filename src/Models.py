        Applies L1 regularization (Lasso) to the gradient during the weight update step in gradient descent.
        L1 regularization encourages sparsity in the model weights, potentially setting some weights to zero,
        which can serve as a form of feature selection.

        The L1 regularization term is added directly to the gradient of the loss function with respect to
        the weights. This term is proportional to the sign of each weight, scaled by the regularization
        strength (C) and inversely proportional to the number of samples (m).

        Parameters:
        - dw (np.ndarray): The gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights, before regularization.
        - m (int): The number of samples in the dataset.
        - C (float): Inverse of regularization strength; must be a positive float.

        Applies L2 regularization (Ridge) to the gradient during the weight update step in gradient descent.
        L2 regularization penalizes the square of the weights, which discourages large weights and helps to
        prevent overfitting by promoting smaller and more distributed weight values.

        The L2 regularization term is added to the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights

        proportional to the number of samples (m).

        Applies Elastic Net regularization to the gradient during the weight update step in gradient descent.
        Elastic Net combines L1 and L2 regularization, incorporating both the sparsity-inducing properties
        of L1 and the weight shrinkage effect of L2. This can lead to a model that is robust to various types
        of data and prevents overfitting.

        The regularization term combines the L1 and L2 terms, scaled by the regularization strength (C) and
        the mix ratio (l1_ratio) between L1 and L2 regularization. The term is inversely proportional to the
        number of samples (m).

        Parameters:
        - dw (np.ndarray): The gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights, before regularization.
        - m (int): The number of samples in the dataset.
