## 🌍 <span id="general-description">General Description </span>  

This project develops predictive models to analyze the factors influencing students' academic performance in two high schools in Madrid in 2005. Using demographic, social, and academic data, two models are built: one that includes previous grades and another that excludes these values to assess the influence of other factors. The objective is to understand which variables have the most impact on the final grade and explore strategies to improve student performance.
